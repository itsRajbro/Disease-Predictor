## 🏋️ Training the Models

Datasets used (available on Kaggle):

| Model | Dataset |
|---|---|
| CXR | [COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) |
| Malaria | [Cell Images for Detecting Malaria](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria) |
| Ocular | [Ocular Disease Recognition ODIR5K](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k) |
| Brain Tumor | [Brain MRI Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection) |

Place datasets in the `datasets/` folder and run:

```bash
cd training
python train_cxr.py
python train_malaria.py
python train_ocular.py
python train_brain.py
```

Trained models will be saved to the `models/` folder.
